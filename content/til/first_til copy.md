These are some of prompts I have used to prompt Gemini to help me practice for IELTS speaking test. I have used the following prompts to simulate the test and get feedback on my responses.

I still need to refine these prompts, but they are a good starting point.

#### Part 1: Introduction and Interview

```markdown
Please ask me 3-4 questions, one at a time, on the topic of **[TOPIC]**. After I answer each question, please:

1. **Correct any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing in my answer.**
2. **Suggest better vocabulary or expressions if appropriate.**
3. **Help me to expand my answer by asking a follow-up question or suggesting ways to add more detail.**
4. **Allow me to repeat my answer incorporating your corrections, suggestions, and expanded details.**

If I seem to be struggling or don't know what to say, please provide a more direct follow-up question to prompt me.

Let's begin with Part 1.
