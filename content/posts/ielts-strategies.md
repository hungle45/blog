## Listening

### Multiple Choise Questions

#### Before listening

1. Read the questions carefully -> applying specify strategy to understand the main idea.

    ```bash
    # Given the question:
    QUESTION = "The film that is now shown at The Family Event is about"

    # Breakdown the structure:
    STRUTURES="\
        [Subject]
        ├── [Noun Phrase] - The film
        │     └── [Relative Clause] - that is now shown at The Family Event
        └── [Verb Phrase] - is about
    "

    # Identify the main idea:
    MAIN_IDEA = "The topic of the film"
    ```

2. `[OPTIONAL]` Read the options.

    - Priortize the long options, can skip the short ones.
    - Identify the key differences between the options.

#### While listening

As you listen, select the correct option and *cross out the incorrect ones* based on the `indicators`.

Here are some common `indicators`. In the left column, the $B$ represents the correct answer, while $A$ represents the incorrect one, and otherwise.

| Negative to Affirmative | Affirmative to Negative |
| :--------------------- | :-------------- |
| I don't think it's $A$. In my opinion, it's $B$ | I think it's $A$ because $B$ isn't suitable/good |
| Not $A$ but $B$ | $A$ rather than $B$  |
| It's not $A$. Instead/Rather, it's $B$  | $A$, not $B$ |

| Hypothesis to Reality | Reality to Hypothesis |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------- |
| would have been $A$, but it was actually $B$ | it was actually $A$ although it would have been $B$ |
| we thought it was $A$, but it turned out to be $B$ | it was actually $A$ although we thought it was $B$ |
| we planned to do $A$, but we ended up doing $B$ | we ended up doing $A$, although we planned to do $B$ |

| Past to Present | Present to Past |
| :-------------- | :-------------- |
| used to be $A$ but now $B$ | $A$ although it used to be $B$ |
| initially $A$ but today $B$ | $A$ although initially it was $B$ |
